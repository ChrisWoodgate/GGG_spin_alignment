# GGG\_spin\_alignment

A code for examining spin canting induced by the dipole-dipole interaction in Gadolinium Gallium Garnet (GGG) in the high field, low temperature regime.

Developed as part of a final year project on the University of Warwick's undergraduate Mathematics and Physics programme. This project was supervised by Dr Nick d'Ambrumenil and the core portion of the code is based on a Mathematica notebook of his.

This work was conducted as a follow-up to an earlier publication: [Phys. Rev. Lett. **114**, 227203 (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.227203)
